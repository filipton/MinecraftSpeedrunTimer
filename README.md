# MinecraftSpeedrunTimer
Basic timer in WPF for speedruning minecraft (any version)

## How does it works?
* First, the program searches for the latest Minecraft world and takes world play time.
* Also if you save the world time automatically changes.
* Real world time will reset if you create new world.
